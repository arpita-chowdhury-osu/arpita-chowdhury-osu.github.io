üè´ I am a <b>Ph.D. Student</b> in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at <b>[The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/)</b>, advised by <b>[Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao)</b>. 

Currently, My research interests lies in <b>machine learning</b> and <b>computer vision</b>. Specifically,
- Transfer Learning
- In-Context Learning
- Neural Network Interpretability
- Model Merging

Previously, I received my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering from IIT in [University of Dhaka](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/). I also had a wonderful time working as a backend engineer in <b>[Samsung R&D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/srbd)</b>

Application wise, 
- ü¶ã I am doing research in a wonderful team of <b>[Imageomics](https://imageomics.osu.edu/)</b> where I work on <b>fine-grained classification</b>  and trait discovery. 
- ü©∫ I am also working with [Somashekar Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lW7g3OEAAAAJ) from <b>[The Ohio State University Medical Center](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/)</b> on <b>pancreatic cancer diagonosis from video</b> .
