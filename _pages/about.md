üè´ I am a Ph.D. Student in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao). 

Currently, My research interests are in
- Transfer Learning
- In-Context Learning
- Neural Network Interpretability
- Model Merging

Previously, I received my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering from IIT in [University of Dhaka](http://www.iit.du.ac.bd/). I also had a wonderful time working as a backend engineer in [Samsung R&D Institute](https://research.samsung.com/srbd)

Application wise, 
- ü¶ã I am doing research in a wonderful team of [Imageomics](https://imageomics.osu.edu/) where I work on fine-grained classification and trait discovery. 
- ü©∫ I am also working with [Somashekar Krishna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lW7g3OEAAAAJ) from [The Ohio State University Medical Center](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/) on pancreatic cancer diagonosis from video.
